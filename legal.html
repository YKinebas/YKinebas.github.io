        <p>Detailed documents to follow.
            Broadly, this is not a "professional" sleek app, it is a garage project written largely by various AI tools.
            
            As far as data privacy:
            1. App uses OpenAI Business API, therefore the data is subject to OpenAI privacy policy
            2. Upon installation, slack workspace ID is stored
            3. As part of the normal operation, Slack usernames are read by the app. These are not retained in any way.
            4. No personal data is otherwise retained or shared
            5. Usage data is retained in AWS for error monitoring
            6. None of the content transferred via the app is retained or shared
            
            Basically, I don't really care about your data and don't intend to use or share it in any way.
            If you're really concerned, build this yourself and run locally, it's not difficult and I'm happy to share some or parts of the code.
