        <h1>Disclaimers & Legal Text</h1>
        <p>Detailed documents to follow.</p>
        <p>Broadly, this is not a "professional" sleek app, it is a garage project written largely by various AI tools.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As far as data privacy:</p>
        <p>1. App uses OpenAI Business API, therefore the data is subject to OpenAI privacy policy</p>
        <p>2. Upon installation, slack workspace ID is stored</p>
        <p>3. As part of the normal operation, Slack usernames are read by the app. These are not retained in any way.</p>
        <p>4. No personal data is otherwise retained or shared</p>
        <p>5. Usage data is retained in AWS for error monitoring</p>
        <p>6. None of the content transferred via the app is retained or shared</p>
        <p></p> 
        <p>Basically, I don't really care about your data and don't intend to use or share it in any way.</p>
        <p>If you're really concerned, build this yourself and run locally, it's not difficult and I'm happy to share some or parts of the code.</p>
