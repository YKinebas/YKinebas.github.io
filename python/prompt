Your mandate is to architect a comprehensive web application prepared for GitHub repository hosting. This application encompasses three HTML pages, enhanced with CSS and JavaScript. Fulfill the subsequent specifications:

Three Pages: Home Page, Donation Page, Disclaimers & Legal Page.

Content Placeholders: Insert text placeholders tagged as <<Home Page Text>>, <<Donation Page Text>>, and <<Disclaimers & Legal Text>>.

Image Placeholders: Incorporate image placeholders marked as <<Logo Filename>> and <<HomePage Banner Filename>>.

Colour Schemes: Embed three color types: <<Dominant Colour Hex>> is #0F0F31, <<Secondary Colour A Hex>> is #9A57D8, and <<Text Colour Hex>> is #FFFEFF.

Page Layout: Design each page to present a centered logo at the top, navigation elements with button-like styling linked to other site pages, and left-aligned text and links.

Annotations: Incorporate detailed comments and annotations within the code to elucidate intricate logic and design choices.

README.md: Generate a Markdown-formatted README.md that explicates how the code files interact, incorporating sections such as Introduction, File Structure, and Usage Instructions that include a sample command sequence for local deployment.

SEO: Insert SEO meta tags like "Slack", "GPT plugin", "Slack digest", "Slack bot", and "AI bot" into the HTML head section of all three pages.

My requirement for the code is explicit: it must be concise, logical, and rigorously adhere to best practices. The code should be replete with detailed annotations and comments to facilitate future amendments.
