        <<Welcome to SumBot - Your personal Slack assistant
        ðŸ¤– What's SumBot?
        SumBot uses ChatGPT to summarize Slack threads and channels. Depending on your request, it can create lists of actions, pull out key takeaways, and generally cut through the noise of a long Slack thread or busy channel. It simplifies your conversations, helping you focus on the critical content. No more endless scrolling â€“ SumBot delivers clarity.
        How does it work?
        Powered by GPT-4, the model is first given a personality. This will soon become customizable, but currently explains its job to summarize threads, and tells it to highlight legal and financial facts and challenges.>>
